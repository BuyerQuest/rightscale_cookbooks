Default values are noted.\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:version]</tt> -\n  The package version. Default: \"10.24.0-1\"\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:config_dir]</tt> -\n  The Chef Client config directory. Default: \"/etc/chef\"\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:server_url]</tt> -\n  The url to connect to the remote Chef Server.\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:private_ssh_key]</tt> -\n  Private ssh key to register the Chef Client with the Chef Server.\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:validation_name]</tt> -\n  Validation name, along with the private ssh key, is used to determine whether\n  the Chef Client may register with the Chef Server. The validation_name located\n  on the server and in the client configuration file must match.\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:node_name]</tt> -\n  The node's name to register on the Chef Server.\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:roles]</tt> -\n  Comma separated list of roles which will be applied to this instance. Roles\n  should be defined on the Chef Server else recipe will fail.\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:environment]</tt> -\n  The Chef Server environment name, by default the Chef Client environment\n  variable is set to \"_default\".\n* <tt>node[:chef][:client][:company]</tt> -\n  The name of the company which is defined on the Chef Server.\n\n=== Templates:\n\n* <tt>chef_client_conf.erb</tt> -\n  The Chef Client configuration file. Used in <tt>chef::do_attach</tt> recipe.\n* <tt>private_ssh_key.erb</tt> -\n  The Chef Client private ssh key. Used in <tt>chef::do_attach</tt> recipe.\n* <tt>runlist.json.erb</tt> -\n  The Chef Client runlist.json file. Defined in setup_runlist definition and\n  used in<tt>chef::do_attach</tt> and <tt>chef::execute_runlist</tt> recipes.\n\n=== Usage Example:\n* <tt>chef::do_attach</tt>\n  This recipe is used in boot phase to register the Chef Client on the Chef\n  Server. It is also available in operational phase. Before using this recipe in\n  operational phase user need to execute <tt>chef::detach</tt> recipe to remove\n  all the configuration files from the client. To use a different Chef Server,\n  user should change the server_url input. To reconnect to the same Chef Server,\n  user need to either change the node name input or remove the node and client\n  registration entries from the server.\n\nNote : Above usage example is not applicable to connect to the Rightscale Chef\nServer template.\n\n* <tt>chef::execute_runlist</tt>\n  This recipe is used in operational phase only. It re-runs runlist received\n  from the Chef Server. To update the roles user can provide new roles as input\n  and run the recipe. Roles to be used should be available on the Chef Server.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
