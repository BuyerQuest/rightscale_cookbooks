If the primary server crashes then some transactions that were committed may not have been replicated to the standby server, causing data loss. The amount of data loss is proportional to the replication delay at the time of failover. Synchronous replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes made by a transaction have been transferred to one synchronous standby server. This extends the standard level of durability offered by a transaction commit. This level of protection is referred to as 2-safe replication in computer science theory.

  "long_description": "# RightScale PostgreSQL Database Cookbook\n\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nProvides the PostgreSQL implementation of the 'db' resource to install and\nmanage PostgreSQL database stand-alone servers and clients.\n\n## DETAILS\n\nThe 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be\nfound in the providers/default.rb file.\n\n## REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage\n* Needs RightScale ServerTemplate tools gem installed on system.\n\n## COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see `metadata.rb` file for the latest dependencies.\n\n## KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n## SETUP:\n\n* To setup only the database client, place `db::default` recipe into\n  your runlist. This will pull in generic client inputs, provide\n  provider selection input and install client. Set db/provider_type input in\n  RightScale ServerTemplate to set provider and version for 'db' resource.\n* To setup a PostgreSQL database client and server, place the following recipes\n  in order to your runlist:\n\n    db_postgres::setup_server_<version>\n      loads the PostgreSQL provider, tuning parameters, as well as other\n      PostgreSQL-specific attributes into the node as inputs.\n    db::install_server\n      sets up generic server and client inputs. This will also include\n      db::default recipe which installs the client.\n\n  For example: To set up and install PostgreSQL 9.1 client and server\n\n    db_postgres::setup_server_9_1\n    db::install_server\n\n## USAGE:\n\n### Basic usage\n\nOnce setup, use the recipes in the 'db' cookbook to install and manage your\nPostgreSQL database servers and clients. See the `db/README.md` for usage\ndetails.\n\n### PostgreSQL Tuning and postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf\n\nCustom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the\n`postgresql.conf.erb` template or by setting the values in the attributes\nfile. For more information and an example override repository, please see:\n[Override Chef Cookbooks][CCDG].\n\n[CCDG]: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Override_Chef_Cookbooks\n\nThe tuning parameters are adjusted based on the database server usage. Shared\nservers are allocated %50 of the resources of a dedicated server.\n\nThe current implementation sets the following tuning parameters:\n\n* max_connections: Static setting with 400 for a dedicated server\n  and 200 for a shared server\n* shared_buffers: Dynamically set to %25 of available memory.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\nThe 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be\nfound in the `providers/default.rb` file.\n\n## LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
